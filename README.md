# 🌐 Bilingual JSON Translation Files for Developers (Arabic - English)

Welcome to the **Bilingual JSON Translation Files** repository! 🎉 This project provides a curated collection of the most commonly used programming-related words and phrases in both Arabic and English, designed to help developers build bilingual applications faster and with greater consistency. 🚀

## ❓ Why This Project?

In software development, programmers frequently write and translate common terms such as `"login"`, `"signUp"`, `"passwordChanged"`, and more. This repetition wastes time ⏳ and can lead to inconsistent terminology or translation errors across projects. ⚠️

This project aims to:

- ⏱️ Save time and effort by providing ready-to-use, standardized translations  
- 🧩 Ensure consistent terminology across different projects and teams  
- 🚫 Reduce translation mistakes and mismatches between Arabic and English  
- 🎨 Support bilingual UI/UX development with a clean and maintainable structure
